Hi, Iâ€™m Rohan Lodhi ðŸ‘‹. Into systems, low-level, and the hardware-software interaction.

I like breaking down how things work, from interpreters to networks. Mostly C/C++, Python, and tinkering with compilers, shells, and other low level stuff. I enjoy the intersection of performance, security, and minimal design. Although, I blog about everything and anything.
